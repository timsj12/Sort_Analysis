I was not able to my program to write my output (Comparisons and Exchanges to a File)  They output to
to the console.  Each file needs to be ran individually :(  My apologies.  Been busy and ran
out of time.

Size data set files will output all exchanges and comparisons to the console.

In order for this to happen  filename must be "***50.txt"  the 4th and 5th characters must be "50"

All other size files will only provide the comparison and exchange summary to the console.
